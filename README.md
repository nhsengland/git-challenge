# git-challenge

Git challenge to learn the key git commands. Just add your name to the guestbook file!

You'll need to:

1) [Create an access token](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/quick_start_guides/github_quick_start_guide/#generating-a-personal-access-token-pat)
2) [Clone the repo and use your access token for authorisation](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/quick_start_guides/github_quick_start_guide/#using-your-pat-on-your-local-git-installation)
3) [Create a branch](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/git_walkthroughs/working_with_branches_walkthrough/)
4) Add your name to guestbook.md and save the file
5) [`add` the guestbook.md file](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/git_walkthroughs/committing_work_walkthrough/#stage-files) (this step is also known as 'staging')
6) [`commit` your change](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/git_walkthroughs/committing_work_walkthrough/#commit-files)
7) [`push` your branch](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/git_walkthroughs/pull_and_merge_requests_walkthrough/#push-commits) to the remote repo
8) Because you have made your branch locally on your computer, but it doesn't exist in the remote repo, you might get an error here. If you do, don't worry! Git will tell you the command you should use instead. It will look something like this: `git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name`. Just copy and paste this command into the terminal and run it.
9) [Create a Pull Request](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/git_walkthroughs/pull_and_merge_requests_walkthrough/#create-a-new-pull-request) for your change to be merged into the main branch
10) [Request a reviewer](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) for your pull request
